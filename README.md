I have implemented a interface of the system to a student schedule, when each lesson consists of: lecture, lab, practice.
And can import the list of lessons from the beginning of a semester from Excel<br>

After the user has selected all his lessons, he can now see a full calendar view of the lessons he chose, and can choose exactly what percentage of the options he has to display in the log, from what day and time to the pre-entered data in the previous step<br>

Finally, you can save the system state you planned.
Or import a save you've made ..<br>

I was inspired to develop this software after trying to design a set of hours according to a list of lessons given at the beginning of the semester, and it was difficult to find all these conflicts according to lines of text, so I wrote this program, , To search for a limited system in terms of time windows between classes, without collisions.</font>
